A new home for my blog! This is a static site hosted on github pages created using Jekyll. The theme is a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). This gets you up and running in minutes even for a person who has zero knowledge of Jekyll, avoiding all the annoying installation details and gems.
