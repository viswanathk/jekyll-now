This is a new home for my blog! This is a static site hosted on github pages. This is created using Jekyll and the theme is a fork of https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now. This gets you up and running literally in minutes even for a person who has zero knowledge of Jekyll, avoiding all the annoying installation details and gems.
