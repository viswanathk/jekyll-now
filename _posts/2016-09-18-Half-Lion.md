P V Narasimha Rao was amongst the most celebrated Prime Ministers of India. Hailed as the Architect of Modern India, he was the reason behind the current standard of living enjoyed by millions of middle-class Indians. He was also blamed for various failings of congress government, the most important one being the way he handled Babri-Masjid demolition. This book, Half-Lion: How P.V Narasimha Rao Transformed India, is an impartial account of his life, going into depths of his personal and political life and supporting those versions with citations.

For anyone whose idea of PV is the name on a few river fronts and flyovers, this book would be an eye-opener. It starts off by describing the legacy of PV – disowned and insulted by Congress and respected by the opposition. Then we find a detailed account of his early life, and learn that as an academic, he was variously talented but as a politician, he was weak. For this very reason, he was nominated as CM, a socialist who suffered financial losses by his own laws, although he later changed his views, realizing that socialism was not enough to improve the life of his citizens.

He ran a minority government during a time when the idea of Nehruvian-socialism was so entrenched that openly opposing it would be a political suicide for a congress politician. He lacked the charisma to gain the support of Indian population, the political power to oppose the communist roots and still managed to steer the country through the worst financial time by radical structural amends even majority governments are not able to pass today – and lasted a full term even after 3 attempts to dethrone him. He abandoned Nehruvian idealism for pragmatism and set a precedent for all the future governments to follow on international policy. He did all this by playing a lion when he can (and sometimes misjudging those situations), a fox with his ministers and a mouse with Nehru-Gandhi family.

The author gives accounts of events that happened before the Babri-Masjid demolition, the fix PV was put into - between a rock and a hard place where any action by him would have caused uproar. There are many familiar names such as Abdul Kalam – a political account of his contributions to defense, Subramanian Swami – which changed my view of him from an idealist to a rationalist, and PV’s own critical role in India’s nuclear prowess acknowledged by Atal Bihari Vajpayee when he addressed PV as the “True Father” of India’s nuclear program.

This book is a must read for anyone to learn about Indian politics as it gives insights into the day to day political events and what it takes to gather support from the party to push through reforms.

TL;DR
Great book, must read. (4.5/5)
