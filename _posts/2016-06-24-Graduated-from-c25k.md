title: Graduated from Couch to 5K!
---

I started the program back in January 2014, but quit after 2 weeks. I restarted multiple times but each time to the same effect. My last attempt was in January of this year, but I paused in February, and then resumed in March.

When I started, I could barely run for 90 seconds straight, and it felt unreal that I can eventually run 5 kilometers at a stretch. The major checkpoint was Week 5 Day 3, when I had to run for 20 minutes straight. Today marks the day I finally finished running 5 kilometers - in 35 minutes. This is great progress for a person who was not able to run for 90 seconds without feeling like he is going to die.

My new target is to finish 10 KM in 60 minutes and of course, increasing speed!
